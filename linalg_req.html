        To obtain the course credit, it is necessary to earn at least 120 points out of a total of 240 points awarded throughout the semester.<br><br>

        Students who have earned at least 100 points by the end of the course may make up the remaining points by completing additional homework assignments or taking an extra written test (according to the instructor's instructions).<br><br>

        In justified cases (long-term illness, stay abroad, etc.), the instructor may set individual conditions for awarding the credit.<br><br>

        The course credit ("zápočet") is a prerequisite for taking the exam.<br><br>

        Any kind of cheating constitutes grounds for withholding the course credit.<br><br>
