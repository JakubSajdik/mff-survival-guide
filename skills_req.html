        Classes in English: For a course credit, you must score at least 50% on the written test toward the end of semester.<br><br>
        Active participation in classes and satisfactory performance in an oral examination may also be taken into account.<br><br>

        A written test for which the score was lower than 50%, or that has been missed due to absence, <br><br>
        can be (re)taken latest by the end of the exam period that follows the semester. There is no other provision for repeated attempts at obtaining a course credit.<br><br>
