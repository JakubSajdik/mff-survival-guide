            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Studying at university can feel overwhelming, especially during the first semester.
                This short guide presents a simple, effective approach to preparing for exams. 
                The idea is to build habits that make studying sustainable instead of stressful.
                As one professor likes to say: <q>small, consistent progress beats any last-minute sprint</q>.

            <h2>The Weekly System</h2>
            <p>
                The most efficient way to study is to repeat material regularly. A good rule is:
                <em>study a little every day, instead of a lot once a week</em>. 
                Even 30 focused minutes can be far more effective than three hours of distracted reading.
            </p>
            <p>
                A helpful routine looks like this:
                <code>lecture → practise → review</code>.
                First learn the concept, then solve a few exercises, and finally revisit older topics.

            <h2>Active Learning</h2>
            <p>
                Active learning means doing something with the material instead of passively reading it.
                For example:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>solving problems without looking at the solution
                    <ul>
                        <li>try solving under time pressure</li>
                        <li>compare your final answer with the official one</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>explaining concepts to a friend
                    <ul>
                        <li>use simple language</li>
                        <li>check whether they actually understood</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>rewriting definitions in your own words</li>

                <li>creating your own small examples
                    <ul>
                        <li>invent easy cases</li>
                        <li>invent tricky edge cases</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                These techniques force your brain to think more deeply, making the material stick.

            <h2>Managing Stress</h2>
            <p>
                Many students underestimate the effect of good sleep and breaks.
                Your brain learns faster when rested. 
                If you feel stuck, take a short break or go for a walk. 
                Sometimes stepping away for 10 minutes can save hours of frustration.

            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p>
                Studying efficiently is not about working more, but about working smarter. 
                Start early, repeat often, and keep your study sessions short and focused. 
                With consistency and the right mindset, even the hardest subjects become manageable.
