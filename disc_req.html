        For credit you need to get 90 points out of at least 150 possible continuously awarded for tests, homework and other activities.<br><br>

        The ongoing nature of the inspection does not imply a right to request corrective tests nor alternative homework assignments.<br><br>


        In justified cases (long-term illness, stay abroad, etc.) the lecturer may set individual conditions for credit granting.<br><br>


        Credit is a condition for taking the exam. Unethical academic practices such as cheating, plagiarism will result in a failure to obtain course credit.<br><br>


        The exam can be written, oral or combined. The exam may be arranged in contact or distant form.<br><br>

        The exam format is decided by the educator(s).<br><br>
